 * #ArvBuffer provides a class for the instantiation of buffers used for the
 * storage of the separate images of the video stream. The actual data space
 * may either be allocated by #ArvBuffer during an object instatiation, of
 * preallocated. #ArvBuffer also allows the transmission of image metadata,
 * such as offsets and size of the transmitted region of interrest, pixel
 * format and time stamp.
